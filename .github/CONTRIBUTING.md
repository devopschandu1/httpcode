# CONTRIBUTING #

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request open an issue first.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes. The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
